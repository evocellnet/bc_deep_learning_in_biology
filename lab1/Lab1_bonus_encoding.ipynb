    "# Lab 1: Introduction to Neural Networks\n",
    "In this tutorial we introduce some of the concepts for working with neural networks using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes_index.html). The entire notebook can be executed as-is, given the lack of time for this first lab session. We encourage you to explore the code yourselves to get comfortable with the concepts of deel learning in the context of biology. A few questions at the end challenge you to play around with the code and try things for yourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, you will create a simple neural network that classifies any given DNA sequence as protein coding or not. As a starting point, we use as examples the coding DNA sequences from humans (homo sapiens (HS)). As negatives, we use random sequences of DNA where each nucleotide is drawn from a uniform distribution over the possible nucleotides. We then train a neural network on de [codon frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_and_RNA_codon_tables) of these sequences. In addition to human DNA sequences, we also take a look at coding sequences from mice ([mus musculus (MM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_mouse)) and yeast ([saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae)). \n"

    "# Step 2: Encoding sequences as codon frequencies\n",
    "The steps above give us a set of unique coding sequences for humans, mice and yeast. To train a neural network on de coding frequencies of these sequences, we encode the sequences by converting each sequence to an array of frequencies for each possible codon. Each codon gets assigned a index in the array. We first create a 'language' that knows all possible words (codons) for a given codon length and input sequence. This language then allows us to convert between codon (e.g., 'ATG') and indices in the array (e.g., 'ATG' -> 0) to keep track of the codon frequencies. Here, we use Tensors - the datatype used for pytorch data - to store the coding frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biologically, [DNA codons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_and_RNA_codon_tables) consist of three nucleotides, encoding amino acids. However, since we are training a neural network to classify a sequence to be protein coding or not, we can choose any number of nucleotides to represent a 'codon'. For example, we can choose a \"codon length\" (codon_length) of a single nucleotide (which would result in us training the model on the [frequencies of nucleotides in DNA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC403801/)), or a codon length of two nucleotides (no biological meaning as this does not represent a biological unit - we do not expect a model to learn any biology at all), or a codon length of 6 nucleotides (representing pairs of amino acids - would this yield a model that \"learns\" any biology?). You can play around with the codon_length yourself, but we start with a codon length of 3 nucleotides - represeting one amino acid. "
