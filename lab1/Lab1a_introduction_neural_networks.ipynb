    "# Lab 1: Introduction to Neural Networks\n",
    "In this tutorial we introduce some of the concepts for working with neural networks using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes_index.html). The entire notebook can be executed as-is, given the lack of time for this first lab session. We encourage you to explore the code yourselves to get comfortable with the concepts of deel learning in the context of biology. A few questions at the end challenge you to play around with the code and try things for yourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, you will create a simple neural network that classifies any given DNA sequence as protein coding or not. As a starting point, we use as examples the coding DNA sequences from humans (homo sapiens (HS)). As negatives, we use random sequences of DNA where each nucleotide is drawn from a uniform distribution over the possible nucleotides. We then train a neural network on de [codon frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_and_RNA_codon_tables) of these sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to human DNA sequences, we also take a look at coding sequences from mice ([mus musculus (MM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_mouse)) and yeast ([saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae)). There are subtle differences between the coding frequencies of these species. You will test how well your human-trained model is able to recover the coding sequences for mice and yeast (think of your results in the context of evolutionary distances between species). \n"

    "# Step 1: Loading the data\n",
    "For your convenience, we provide the pre-processed and encoded sequences. That is, we pre-processed human, mouse and yeast DNA sequences by filtering for coding sequences that contain an integer number of codons, that are of sufficient length for computing codon frequencies (>=300 base pairs), whose translation encodes a protein (start and stop codon). We removed duplicates and randomly mixed the sequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then encoded these sequences by computing the codon frequencies for each sequence. Here we load this data set. To train a neural network on de coding frequencies of these sequences, we encoded the sequences by converting each sequence to an array of frequencies for each possible codon. To do so, each codon gets assigned a index in the array. This array allows us to convert between codon (e.g., 'ATG') and indices in the array (e.g., 'ATG' -> 0) to keep track of the codon frequencies. We use Tensors - the datatype used for pytorch data - to store the coding frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biologically, [DNA codons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_and_RNA_codon_tables) consist of three nucleotides, encoding amino acids. However, since we are training a neural network to classify a sequence to be protein coding or not, we can choose any number of nucleotides to represent a 'codon'. For example, we can choose a \"codon length\" of a single nucleotide (which would result in us training the model on the [frequencies of nucleotides in DNA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC403801/)), or a codon length of two nucleotides (no biological meaning as this does not represent a biological unit - we do not expect a model to learn any biology at all), or a codon length of 6 nucleotides (representing pairs of amino acids - would this yield a model that \"learns\" any biology?). You can play around with the yourself in the notebook that creates the codon frequencies, but we start with a codon length of 3 nucleotides - represeting one amino acid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for each human sequence, we also created a random sequence of codons following the same sequence length distribution as the DNA sequences. These nucleotides are drawn from a random uniform distribution over the possible codons. These random sequences are used as negatives (i.e., label = 1 will tell the model that a sequence is protein coding, label = 0 tells the model that a sequence is not protein coding). \n",
