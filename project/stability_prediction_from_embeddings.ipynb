    "# Project: Protein stability prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the project you will try to predict protein stability changes upon point mutations. \n",
    "We will use acuumulated data from experimental databases, i.e. the Megascale dataset. A current [pre-print paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10402116/) has already preprocessed the dataset and created homology reduced data splits. We will reuse these. To do so, download the data folder from [here](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/txvcb5jKy1A0TbY) and unzip it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data includes measurements of changes in the Gibbs free enrgy ($\\Delta \\Delta G $). \n",
    "This will be the value that you will have to predict for a given protein with a point mutation. \n",
    "As input data you can use the protein sequence or a protein embedding retreived from ESM, a state of the art protein model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will use protein embeddings computed by ESM as input. \n",
    "We provide precomputed embeddings from the last layer of the smallest ESM model. You can adjust the Dataloader's code to load the embedding of the wild type or of the mutaed sequence or both. You can use it however you like. This is just to provide you easy access to embeddings. If you want to compute your own embeddings from other layers or models you can do that, too. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below we provide you with a strcuture for the project that you can start with.  \n",
    "Edit the cells to your liking and add more code to create your final model."
