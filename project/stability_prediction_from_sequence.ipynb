    "# Project: Protein stability prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the project you will try to predict protein stability changes upon point mutations. \n",
    "We will use acuumulated data from experimental databases, i.e. the Megascale dataset. A current [paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2314853121) has already preprocessed the dataset and created homology reduced data splits. We will reuse these. To do so, download the data folder from [here](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/txvcb5jKy1A0TbY) and unzip it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data includes measurements of changes in the Gibbs free enrgy ($\\Delta \\Delta G $). \n",
    "This will be the value that you will have to predict for a given protein with a point mutation. \n",
    "As input data you can use the protein sequence or a protein embedding retreived from ESM, a state of the art protein model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will use the sequence as input. \n",
    "The model will predict the $\\Delta \\Delta G $ of point mutations in this sequence. To make training more efficient, the model should directly predict the values for all possible mutations at each position in the sequence. So the expected output is a sequence of $ L \\ (sequence \\ length) \\ x \\ 20 \\ (number \\ amino \\ acids)$. This will be shown in detail later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we provide you with a strcuture for the project that you can start with.  \n",
    "Edit the cells to your liking and add more code to create your final model."
