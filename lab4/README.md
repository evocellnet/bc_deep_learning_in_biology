# Fine-tuning protein language models

This lab consists of two notebooks:

[1_plm-embeddings.ipynb](1_plm-embeddings.ipynb) explore embeddings in ESM2, a state-of-the-art protein language model, reproducing parts of ([Vig et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2006.15222)).

[2_plm-fine-tuning.ipynb](2_plm-fine-tuning.ipynb) fine-tune ESM2 to predict protein localisation from sequence, reproducing parts of ([Moreno et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btae677)).
